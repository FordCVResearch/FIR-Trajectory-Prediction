The performance of the current collision avoidance systems in Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be drastically affected by low light and adverse weather conditions. Collisions with large animals such as deer in low light cause significant cost and damage every year. In this project, we propose the first AI-based method for future trajectory prediction of large animals and mitigating the risk of collision with them in low light. 

In order to minimize false collision warnings, in our multi-step framework, first, the large animal is accurately detected and a preliminary risk level is predicted for it and low-risk animals are discarded. In the next stage a multi-stream CONV-LSTM-based encoder-decoder framework is designed to predict the future trajectory of the potentially high-risk animals. The proposed model uses camera motion prediction as well as the local and global context of the scene to generate accurate predictions. Furthermore, this project introduces a new dataset of FIR videos for large animal detection and risk estimation in real nighttime driving scenarios. Our experiments show promising results of the proposed framework in adverse conditions. 
This repository contains the main blocks of our code.

=======
## Requirements
We recommend using python3 and a virtual env. When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment with `deactivate`.
```
virtualenv -p python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Task
Given a time series of FIR images from an on-board camera and detected bounding boxes of objects, predict the future locations of those objects.

## Download the dataset

Here is the structure of the dataset:
```
dataset/
    Images/
        seq_0_0001.jpg
        
        ...
    seq/
        seq_00/
            motions/
                seq_00.jpg

                ...

            KeyFrameTrajectory.txt
            seq_00.csv

        ...

    dataset_params.json
            
```
*  The `Images` folder contains all the raw FIR images
* The `seq` folder contains the following informations:
    * `motions` that includes the dense optical flow images
    * `KeyFrameTrajectory.txt` that includes the visual odemetry data
    * `seq_{SEQ_NUMBER}.csv` that has information about the bounding boxes in the current sequence
* `dataset_params.json` in this file you can specify the sequences for train, validation, and test jobs

## Quick Training

1. **Setup the experiment config**:
 You can setup your own training job by creating a new `run_{EXP_NUMBER}`. Then, you can modify the parameters inside the `net_params.json`. The network model definition as well as all the training steps are defined in the `model` folder. However, you should be able to change the network configuration just by changing the parameters in the `net_params.json`. The file looks like

```json
{
    "prediction_length": 30,
    "roi_size": 10,

    "exp_num": 5,
    "cuda": true,
    "learning_rate": 1e-3,
    "batch_size": 4,
    "save_summary_steps": 100,
    ...
    
}
```

2. **Run a Train Job**:
Once the `net_params.json` is set. You can start a training task by calling the `train.py` script from the main directory. Simply run
```
python train.py --experiment_dir ${EXP_JSON_DIR} --data_dir ${DATASET_DIR} --log_dir ${LOG_SAVE_DIR} 
```
It will instantiate a model and train it on the training set following the parameters specified in `net_params.json`. It will also evaluate some metrics on the development set.

3. **Evaluate the Training**:
After the training job is over, you check the evaluation metrices in Tensorboard.
 ```
tensorboard --logdir ./{LOG_SAVE_DIR}/{EXP_NUMBER}/{TRAINING_DATE}
```
4. **Evaluation on the Test Set**:
Once you've selected the best model and hyperparameters based on the performance on the development set, you can finally evaluate the performance of the model on the test set. Run

```
python test.py --experiment_dir {EXP_JSON_DIR} --data_dir ${DATASET_DIR} --model_dir ${LOG_SAVE_DIR} 
```
The model weights are saved in the `${LOG_SAVE_DIR}` as the `best_acc_model`
